Movie Data Analysis Project Description
This Python project uses the pandas library to analyze a movie dataset, focusing on genre popularity and runtime outliers. It employs various data processing techniques, visualizations, and text manipulation to uncover insights into movie genres and viewer preferences.

Key Tasks:
Task 1: Analyzes the frequency of movie genres, identifies the most and least popular genres, and visualizes the top 8 genres to showcase trends.
Task 2: Explores genre distribution by counting occurrences of each genre and determining the most and least common genres.
Task 3: Visualizes runtime outliers using a boxplot and identifies specific outlier movies based on runtime, providing a clear display of data distribution.
Task 4: Examines the relationship between the number of votes a movie receives and its rating, filling in missing data with averages to ensure integrity in analysis.
Task 5: Attempts to analyze the correlation between movie synopses and genre classification through text pattern matching, although it acknowledges difficulties in understanding the task.
Task 6: Investigates the distribution of movie ratings using a histogram and provides statistical descriptions of the ratings, aiding in understanding viewer preferences.
Each function within the code is dedicated to a specific analysis task, making it modular and easy to adapt for further exploration. 
The project provides valuable insights into the entertainment industry, particularly in understanding what genres are trending and how movie characteristics like runtime and ratings distribute across different films.
